  body: A factory class for opening files and returning Operations::File instances that wrap the SFTP handles that represent them. This is a convenience class for use when working with files synchronously. Rather than relying on the programmer to provide callbacks that define a state machine that describes the behavior of the program, this class (and Operations::File) provide an interface where calls will block until they return, mimicking the IO class' interface.
