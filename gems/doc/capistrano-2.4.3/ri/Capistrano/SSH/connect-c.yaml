- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P

  body: <tt>server</tt> must be an instance of ServerDefinition.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If a block is given, the new session is yielded to it, otherwise the new session is returned.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If an :ssh_options key exists in <tt>options</tt>, it is passed to the Net::SSH constructor. Values in <tt>options</tt> are then merged into it, and any connection information in <tt>server</tt> is added last, so that <tt>server</tt> info takes precedence over <tt>options</tt>, which takes precendence over ssh_options.
